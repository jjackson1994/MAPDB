    "They are parallelized general collections of objects, like Python’s built-in `list`, and can therefore hold any Python objects, whether they are custom classes or built-in types. \n",
    "This makes it possible to contain very complicated data structures, like raw text or nested JSON data, and navigate them with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, Dask bags are often used to parallelize simple computations on unstructured or semi-structured data like text data, log files, JSON records, or user defined Python objects, using MapReduce-like approaches to load/inspect/filter arbitrary datasets (structured or unstructured).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask Bag implements in fact operations like `map`, `filter`, `groupby` and aggregations on collections of Python objects.\n",
    "It does this in parallel using Python iterators similarly to a parallel version of itertools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a first stage of data-preparation is completed using Dask Bag, it is quite common to reduce and convert the data into more suitable data structures, such as Dask Arrays or Dask Dataframes, which will be covered later on."
